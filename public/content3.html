									<h1 >1. The Elephanta Caves</h1>
                                    <h2  >Best time to visit: December to January</h2>
                                    <p >The Elephanta Caves, located on Elephanta Island, or Gharapuri, about 11 Km off the coast of the Gateway of India, Mumbai, are a UNESCO World Heritage Site. A visit to these caves, excavated probably in the 6th century CE, is awe-inspiring, and also thought-provoking.
                                        Let us start our journey to Elephanta island at the beginning – on the Jetty at the Gateway of India, Mumbai. As the boat pulls away from the shore, and ships come into better view, we realize that the journey is taking us on a route parallel to the way we came – along the Eastern Freeway. 
                                        
                                        The history of the island goes way back, with numerous remains of habitation from the 2nd/1st century BCE. These include potsherds, coins, remains of a structural brick stupa, water tanks as well as Buddhist caves. The main attraction of the island however, are the Shaiva caves, among which Cave 1 is the most impressive, with some of the most stunning sculptures of different forms of Lord Shiva. These caves are believed to have been created by the Kalachuri Dynasty, in the mid-6th century CE. There are also later structures on the island, including the fort atop the hill and the canons which are a popular tourist attraction.

                    <h1 >2. Ajanta Caves, Maharashtra</h1>
                                      <h2  >Best time to visit:  April to June</h2>
                                      <p >While the island has been occupied, and known, since the early days of the common era, we know of it mostly because of the Portuguese, who arrived in the 15th century, to find the caves abandoned. They gave the island the name we know it by today, because of a stone elephant they found at the landing point. This elephant, once destroyed, has been put together, and stands sentinel today at the Dr. Bhau Daji Lad Museum at Byculla.

                                      The caves, even today, are well hidden by the dense foliage of the island. A rather long walk leads from the landing dock to the base of the hill followed by 120 steps to the caves. A toy train is a major attraction to reach the base of the hill, and a few chairs are available to carry those who cannot walk up the ancient steps to the caves.
                                      
                                      There are a number of caves scattered over the hill, but the main cave, Cave 1 is the only one with sculptures that make it stand out. This cave has three sections, a central section, flanked by two wings, on the east and west. The entrance to this cave today is from the north, though the plan of the cave suggests that the original entry might have been from the east.
                                      
                                      There are nine sculptural panels in the central section of the main cave, among which eight depict Leela-murtis, or different forms of Lord Shiva showing his various sports. The ninth image is the spectacular bust of the three-faced Lord Shiva as Sadashiva or Maheshamurti, who was earlier erroneously described as Trimurti. Slightly off-center is a sarvatobhadra shrine (open in all four directions) with a Shiva Lingam.
                                      
                                      Local guides love telling stories of how the sculptures were used for target practice by the Portuguese to explain their mutilated condition. However, according to scholars, while much of the destruction might have been deliberate, a lot of it can also be attributed to water damage and sheer neglect, and use of the caves for purposes other than they were built for. Nevertheless, despite their mutilated condition, the sculptures retain enough details to stand out and impress visitors, centuries after they were carved
