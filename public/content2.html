									<h1 >1. Jog Falls, Karnataka</h1>
                                    <h2  >Best time to visit: November to January</h2>
                                    <p >This waterfall is very popular and is marked as one of the UNESCO ecological hot spots in the world. It stands as second highest plunge falls in India; its height is 830 feet. <br>
                                    The sight from this spot is breathtaking, attracting tourists heavily, making it through to the top 10 waterfalls in India list. <br><br>
                                    One other feature about Jog Falls is that it is un-tiered waterfall in Karnataka, India, the water flows directly to the ground.
                                    <br>
                                    The intensity of the fall heightens during the monsoons giving it a more beautiful view. The vegetations that grow around the falls are complimentary to it</p>

                                      <h2  >Best time to visit:  October to January</h2>
                                      <p >1. Go Bird Watching
                                        You may not know it, but Andaman is home to a huge flock of birds that can be seen and heard all around the island.
                                        Some of these birds are migratory, but many rare species can be spotted year-round!
                                        The interest in bird watching and photography has increased so much that tours have started being organised to spot them. The tours may take up the full day so plan accordingly.
                                        This local particular  experience in Andaman can be thrilling for wildlife enthusiasts and nature lovers.
                                        
                                        2. Head On A Night Kayaking Trip
                                        Perhaps one of the most beautiful experiences in Andaman, night kayaking certainly deserves more hype. Now, we know that night kayaking can be done in several other places around the world but night kayaking through the bioluminescent effect of the water is truly just exclusive to Andaman.
                                        Explore the quiet of the islands on the calm backwaters of the Andaman Sea. Night Kayak around the region for a tour that takes you through the lush green mangroves of Havelock and introduces you to an experience that is both exciting and soothing at the same time.
                                        One of the safest and easiest water activities on the island, night kayaking is the best way to connect with water for non-swimmers.
                                        The scene is really mystical.
                                        This local experience in Andaman isn’t too tiring and can be experienced by anyone
                                        
                                        
                                        3. Check Out The Mud Volcanoes
                                        Andaman is special and is coincidentally one of the few places in the world where you can witness mud volcanoes.
                                        These small muddy craters are created by natural gases emitted by decaying organic matter underground that push mud upwards.
                                        You shouldn’t expect something big on the lines of the typical volcano eruption or lava spurts, because none of that will really happen.
                                        Most of the time it’s just mud spurting out of the ground.
                                        However, it is a unique geological feature of Andaman that may be intriguing to those who research such phenomena. If possible, give this place a visit.
                                        
                                        4. Sign Up For A Boat Trip To See Barren Island
                                        If you think Andaman can’t get any cooler, you’re in for a surprise.
                                        Despite being just 3 km in length, Barren Island is home to India’s largest active volcano!
                                        The volcano plays a key role in the annual temperature variation and keeping the continental climate stable.
                                        The island is uninhabited, and due to safety concerns, you will not be allowed to set foot on the island.
                                        The closest place to Barren Island is Havelock, from where you can take a ferry to see the island. A lot of great pictures can be taken of this volcanic island!
                                        While the normal attractions do steal the show most of the time, do make space in your schedules for some of these experiences if not all. They will undoubtedly prove to be worth your while.</p>
